This currently requires IronPython and uses WPF. 

It emulates all necessary CAN messages to talk to a Novero HT-4 or HT-5 
bluetooth kit and display the  main menu. Other than that, it's a 
horrible hack that I'm not proud on releasing, but it's a tool. 

It interfaces with a LAWICEL CANUSB device, which must be given on 
the command line.

For example:

IronPython.exe KiSim.py --canusb COM7

pyevent.py (the IronPython one) is required.
